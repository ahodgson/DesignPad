1) [FIXED][BUG]Fixed when adding new functions on the tree( the one that looks like a file system)
	- there was a problem with js, regarding incomplete HEAD information
	- added this code stub into application.html.erb
			somewhere in the top: 
			<%= csrf_meta_tag %>
			...
			<script type="text/javascript">
			  /*
			 * Registers a callback which copies the csrf token into the
			 * X-CSRF-Token header with each ajax request.  Necessary to 
			 * work with rails applications which have fixed
			 * CVE-2011-0447
			*/

			Ajax.Responders.register({
			onCreate: function(request) {
			  var csrf_meta_tag = $$('meta[name=csrf-token]')[0];

			  if (csrf_meta_tag) {
				var header = 'X-CSRF-Token',
					token = csrf_meta_tag.readAttribute('content');

				if (!request.options.requestHeaders) {
				  request.options.requestHeaders = {};
				}
				request.options.requestHeaders[header] = token;
			  }
			}
			});
			</script>
	- revisited after installing the legacy plugin
	- I deleted all the code from above
	- first I got rid of the inline script 
	- it still works...
	- deleted the meta tag, <%= csrf_meta_tag %>
	- now it fails
	- added the metatag
	
	
2) [FIXED][BUG]Now the issue was DELETE and EDIT options 
	- issue was form was posting "/functions/1" 1 is the function that was 
		supposed to be the function id to be edited
	- but it seemed to have thought 1 was the action as it is normally
	- it had something to do when I changed from remote_form_for to form_for for
		rails 3 uprading porpuses.
	- from remote_form_for to form_for, added :remote => true with the options( after :before )
	- this didn't work, had to revert back to remote_form_for
	- Had to install legacy 
	- added this on the Gemfile ( Gemfile is located on the main folder for the application eg. ~\design_pad\ )
		gem 'prototype_legacy_helper', '0.0.0', :git => 'git://github.com/rails/prototype_legacy_helper.git'
	- then ran 'bundle install' to update
	
3) [FIXED][BUG]Issue with Function list and Known Object list on the project show view
	- Had a lot of issues with
		<%= collection_select(:known_objects, :id, known_objects, :id, :name, {}, :multiple=>true) %>
	  and
		<%= collection_select(:functions, :id, functions, :id, :name, {}, :multiple=>true ) %>
	- complaining the first :id in the options was not an array
	- looked up online but nothing with the same issue was found
	- had alot of trouble with this one
	- ... easy solution was to not have a plural name on the first option
	- Changed to 
		<%= collection_select(:known_object, :id, known_objects, :id, :name, {}, :multiple=>true) %>
	  and
		<%= collection_select(:function, :id, functions, :id, :name, {}, :multiple=>true ) %>
	- problem solved
	
4) [FIXED][BUG]Edit button does not work from the project show list (localhost:3000/projects/1#)
	- Problem was that on the button it says ( ~\app\views\functions\app\_functions_list.rhtml)
		<%= link_to "Edit ", "javascript: editFunction()"%>
	- so this function was being called from the application.js file on ~/public/javascripts/
		function editFunction(){
			var functionId=singleSelectedId("functions_id");
			if(functionId)
				window.location="/functions/"+functionId+";edit"
		}
	- as you notice it uses functions_id so i just changed that to function_id
		function editFunction(){
			var functionId=singleSelectedId("function_id");
			if(functionId)
				window.location="/functions/"+functionId+";edit"
		}
	- it solved the problem
	
5) [FIXED][BUG]Edit not linking to the correct page from the project show list (localhost:3000/projects/1#)
	- same button from number 4
	- revisit the javascript
		function editFunction(){
			var functionId=singleSelectedId("function_id");
			if(functionId)
				window.location="/functions/"+functionId+";edit"
		}
	- if you noticed window.location="/functions/"+functionId+";edit"
	- that is the url
	- changed it to window.location="/functions/"+functionId+"/edit"
	- typo before the word edit
	
6) [FIXED][BUG]4 and 5 are the same for known objects. 
	- applied similar changes to them
	
7) [FIXED][BUG]Delete button does not work from the project show list (localhost:3000/projects/1#)
	- Looking at the code behind the button ( ~\app\views\functions\app\_functions_list.rhtml)
		<%= link_to_remote "Delete ", :url=>{:controller=>"functions", :action=>"destroy_multiple"},
									  :with=>"'selected_ids='+selectedIds('functions_id')
                                      +'&function_structure_diagram_id='+#{function_structure_diagram_id}",
										:confirm=>"Are you sure?"
                                    %>
	- its using 'functions_id'
	- changed that to 'function_id'
	- solved
	
8) [FIXED][BUG]7 applies to Known objects list too
	- applied the same change

9) [FIXED][BUG]Can't edit known objects from the edit page
	- hmmm
	- don't know why this stub is in the update action (controllers\known_objects_controller)
		@function_structure_diagram=FunctionStructureDiagram.find(:function_structure_diagram_id)
		@entity_model_name=params[:entity_model_name]
	- not sure if we need them for other kinds of updates
	- we'll have to see later
	- commented them out
	- for now, can edit known objects
	
10) [FIXED][BUG]Error messages don't show up
	- error_messages_for has been deprecated in rails 3
	- check out http://www.emersonlackey.com/article/rails3-error-messages-for-replacement
	- he wrote a stub to replace it
	- basically added this to app/helpers/application_helper.rb
		def errors_for(object, message=nil)
			html = ""
			unless object.errors.blank?
			  html << "<div class='fieldWithErrors #{object.class.name.humanize.downcase}Errors'>\n"
			  if message.blank?
				if object.new_record?
				  html << "\t\t<h5>There was a problem creating the #{object.class.name.humanize.downcase}</h5>\n"
				else
				  html << "\t\t<h5>There was a problem updating the #{object.class.name.humanize.downcase}</h5>\n"
				end    
			  else
				html << "<h5>#{message}</h5>"
			  end  
			  html << "\t\t<ul>\n"
			  object.errors.full_messages.each do |error|
				html << "\t\t\t<li>#{error}</li>\n"
			  end
			  html << "\t\t</ul>\n"
			  html << "\t</div>\n"
			end
			html
		  end  
	- Now instead of calling errors_messages_for, we call errors_for(@object)
	- can do errors_for(@object, "message")
	- replace all calls of error_messages_for to this function call
	- replaced alot of calls from edit/new files of different views
	- example change:
		<% if @team %>
			<%= errors_for @team %>
		<% end %>

11) [FIXED][BUG]Layout is broken
	- something wrong with the layout
	- it doesnt enclose everything in the main/info page
	- hmmm probably just the html
	- had something to do with <%= yield %>, moved it around
	- fixed
	
12) [BUG] Uploading a picture had an error with packet or something
	- This was in FSD uploading a pic
	- Not sure what the pic is for 
	- Hmm gonna look up how to do that
	- looking up online it seems the fix is downgrading to ruby-mysql 2.9.3
	- my current version is 2.9.4
	- actually, am i even using ruby-mysql or just mysql gem, not sure
	- 
	
13) http://motyar.info/blog/2010/01/draw-with-jquery.html
	- How to draw?
	- might not be specific to RoR
	- delving in to canvas tag (fishy on IE support)
	- hmm http://stackoverflow.com/questions/923885/capture-html-canvas-as-gif-jpg-png-pdf
	- [too complicated]hmmmm might have to use paperclip plugin to have thumbnails
	- on canvas, have diff colored pixels, white and black. white is eraser
	- canvas to image http://ajaxian.com/archives/canvas2image-save-out-your-canvas-data-to-images
	- good example here http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas2image/
	- use html5 -- http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/html5-canvas-painting/
	- weird, it doesnt recognize my firefox browser
	- hmmm error, its not that 
	- its just it doesnt know where to find the javascript
	- have to search how to add new javascript
	- I MADE IT DRAW
	- although right now its.. buggy
	- cant select pencil, only line
		- something wrong with select
		- hmm its select_tag in RoR
		- check if used select_tag before
		- nope select_tag hasnt been in code before
		- it has to do something with the array order
		- nope, the default was just "line"
		- done
	- when drawing line, it moves to the right
	- IT DOESNT SAVE! how to save? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2544260/how-to-save-html5-canvas
	- figured out how the drawing takes place
	- have to change so that the options are pencil and eraser
	- [1] Pencil [2] Eraser
	- just duplicated pencil function but have white color instead
	- just set context.strokeStyle = "#000";
	- basically a pencil with white ink
	- http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html#divingin
	- It works!
	- Now just have to figure out how to save it so drawing doesnt go away
	- How to get big eraser? - done. context.lineWidth = 1 ;
	- hmmmmmmmmmmm
	- IMAGES! http://patshaughnessy.net/2009/4/14/database-storage-for-paperclip-rewritten-to-use-a-single-table
	- paperclip plugin
	- trying to integrate now
	- issues installing paperclip -_-
	- typo, easy fix, now inside the gemfile
	- just do bundle install
	- now trying to integrate paperclip with the concept model
	- hmmmm redid all that since the guide was for rails 2
	- cant do anything with it
	- looking at this
	- http://patshaughnessy.net/2010/5/23/how-to-install-paperclip-in-a-rails-3-app
	- did >rails generate paperclip concept avatar to update models
	- nice video tutorial http://membership.thinkvitamin.com/library/ruby-on-rails/forms/file-uploads-with-paperclip-part-1?cid=106
	- omg
	- finally after 5 hours of experimenting
	- attached a photo to a concept
	- how? followed the newest link above
	- display by doing: 
		<%= image_tag @concept.avatar.url %>
	- update by doing this:
		<% form_for(@concept, :url=>{:controller=>"concepts", :action=>"update"}, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |f| %>
		  <p>
		   <%= f.file_field :avatar %>
			<%= submit_tag "Update" %>
		  </p>
		<% end %>
	- this one uses a photo in the computer tho
	- need to upload
	- good first step, regardless
	- need to integrate with the drawing app
	- how?
	- have to figure out how to update the photo without using the file_field tag
	- hmm
	- IDEA!
	- basically, upload through URL
	- meaning the photo doesnt have to be in the computer
	- imgur.com has this
	- hmmm trying to see if we can do this using paperclip
	- wow found a tutorial http://trevorturk.com/2008/12/11/easy-upload-via-url-with-paperclip/
	- lets see if its relevant (its from 2008)
	- fixed the showing screen
	- can now see image on the edit page
	- fixed edit button (didnt have one)
	- hmmm trying to see how to delete uploaded photo(concept photo)
	- success! 
	- used:
		<%=link_to "Remove Photo", {:controllers=> 'concepts', :action => 'delete_avatar', :id => @concept.id} %>
	- had to write a new action for concepts controller
	- new action in concepts controller:
		def delete_avatar
			@concept_id=params[:id]
			@concept=Concept.find(@concept_id)

			respond_to do |format|
			  if @concept.update_attribute(:avatar_file_name, nil)
				flash[:notice]="Avatar has been deleted."
				format.html {redirect_to :id=>@concept_id, :action=>"edit", :controller=>"concepts"}
			  else
				format.html { render :nothing => true }
			  end
			end
		end
	- bug, delete button shows up even if theres no image
	- fixed, fix if statement from concept.avatar to concept.avatar_file_name
	- now the hard part
	- hmm going back to uploading file using url
	- following instuctions on this link http://trevorturk.com/2008/12/11/easy-upload-via-url-with-paperclip/
	- hmm
	- did everything in tutorial
	- tried to upload through url, have problems with concept.rb -- undefined method `image=' for #<Concept:0x1b02d60>
	- it works!
	- problem was this function		
		  def download_remote_image
			self.image = do_download_remote_image
			self.image_remote_url = image_url
		  end
	- designpad didnt have image, changed that to avatar
	- 2 days of research and nothing
	- ASKED IN STACKOVERFLOW  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6264538/rails-how-to-update-avatar-photo-of-a-model-directly
	- got this code https://gist.github.com/1012107
			class Avatar < ActiveRecord::Base

		  attr_accessor :content_type, :original_filename, :image_data
		  before_save :decode_base64_image

		  has_attached_file :image,
			PAPERCLIP_CONFIG.merge(
			:styles => {
			  :thumb => '32x32#',
			  :medium => '64x64#',
			  :large => '256x256#'
			})

		  protected
			def decode_base64_image
			  if image_data && content_type && original_filename
				decoded_data = Base64.decode64(image_data)

				data = StringIO.new(decoded_data)
				data.class_eval do
				  attr_accessor :content_type, :original_filename
				end

				data.content_type = content_type
				data.original_filename = File.basename(original_filename)

				self.image = data
			  end
			end
		end
	- getting closer
	- http://madkingsmusings.blogspot.com/2011/03/crop-and-upload-image-server-side.html
		StringIO.open(Base64.decode64(string)) do |data|
		  data.original_filename = "photo.gif"
		  data.content_type = "image/gif"
		  model.photo = data
		end	
	- IT WORKS!
	- can now save base64 into database
	- aka picture for concept!
	- fixed by using :image_data input instead of :image_url
	- bug, broke computer and url upload
	- fixed, base64 checker was wrong
	- now i have to have the drawing save to db
	- make it so it retrieves base64 image
	- have it so it draws the current concept unto the canvas
	- hmm back to work
	- managed to make canvas to image work
	- have to deal with how to auto save it to db
	- have to deal with how to auto draw concept into canvas
	- WORKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKS!
	- had to ask question at stackoverflow
	- had to use javascript to autofill the form
	- made the text field hidden so we only see the button
	- looks like saving the image directly

	
14) [FIXED]This is how to draw UML diagrams on RoR
 http://railroad.rubyforge.org/#examples
	- nvm it makes uml from the application
	- not really any drawing stuff
	
15) [FIXED] DOESNT WORK ON CHROME
	- found problem on application.js
	- have something to do with adding event handlers
	- example of code:
		if(isIE())
            elements[i].attachEvent("on"+event, func, bool);
        else if(isFireFox())
            elements[i].addEventListener(event, func, bool);
	- Added isChrome function
		function isChrome()
			{
				var i=navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf("chrome");
				return i>=0;
			}
	- Then did 		
		if(isIE())
            elements[i].attachEvent("on"+event, func, bool);
        else if(isFireFox() || isChrome() ) //CHANGED THIS
            elements[i].addEventListener(event, func, bool);
			
16) Adding how to draw FSD mind map
	- hmm, Xmind
	- tab = children
	- enter/return = sibling
	- delete = destroy
	- how?
	- hmmm found new, better one 
	- jit
	- not sure what to do yet
	- example looks good
	- application_helper.rb has the rightclick menu, all the js that handles creating/editing the
		tree, might want to look at that
	- look up projectEditWhenEnterPressed for creating new
